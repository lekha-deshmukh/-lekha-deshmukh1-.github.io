                            I carried out <strong>Guerrilla usability testing</strong> with 3 citizens who were aged 25
                            (techsavy), 42(not techsavy) & 53(not techsavy). I asked them questions to complete certain
                            tasks and noted down time they took to complete it. Based on 1st testing result, few UI
                            changes were made which impacted usability of software drastically. I recorded my screen
                            using Camtasia software and shared recording with entire team with the consent of
                            participants.

                            The product was then tested on a larger scale with 5,000 people (MKCL's ALC Centers) and 1

                            We learned about 500 success stories where Mahalabharthi helped these people with government
                            scheme benefits.
                            These success case studies were then pitched to Govt. of Maharashtra Chief Minister's
                            Office, and the product was launched by CM in entire Maharashtra.
