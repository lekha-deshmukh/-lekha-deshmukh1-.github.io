                            <p>To execute AI-powered Google Ads for our clients, we initially ran ads through Inaiways’
                                Google Ads account on behalf of the clients. This posed a limitation, as we could not
                                directly integrate the API into the clients’ Google Ads accounts. Consequently,
                                providing campaign performance updates to clients required significant time from our
                                customer support team.</p>
                            <p>The primary goals of the dashboard app were:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>To provide clients with real-time insights into their campaigns.</li>
                                <li>To significantly reduce customer support time.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>This app was developed after serving our first 5–10 clients and was a crucial step in
                                scaling our operations rapidly.</p>
