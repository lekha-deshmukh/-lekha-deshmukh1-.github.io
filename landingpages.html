                                        <li> Clients delayed delivering assets, resulting
                                            in
                                            extended timelines of 60–90 days. Clients did not have images related to
                                            their products or services and asked us to pick images, however 40% of the
                                            times they would ask for changes in images which led to delayed deliveries -
                                            we purchased images from Envato Elements & Adobe Stock to make the clients
                                            happy initially, later we asked clients to provide images when they are
                                            ready, till then we used the purchased stock images, this stopped the delay
                                            to go live.</li>
                                        <li>Some Clients did not have enough money to pay for specific service or
                                            product related landing pages for ads - we clubbed the product offerings
                                            into 1 landing page for such clients, and later made an onboarding rule to
                                            only take clients who have paying capacity. </li>

                                        <li><strong>Design:</strong> </li>
                                        <li>Landing Page Design team found it difficult to pick colors for landing pages
                                            - I took training of team on choosing right color like primary secondary and
                                            taught them how to take inspiration from logo of client & client’s website
                                            as well</li>
                                        <li>Landing Page Design team had difficulty picking the right image - to resolve
                                            this we took subscription of envato and adobe stock we discontinued as it
                                            was more expensive. Also Customer success team requested clients to share
                                            images so that design team doesn’t spend extra time in support zone of the
                                            landing page. </li>

                                        <li> Inefficient handoffs between content writers and
                                            designers caused bottlenecks. Content writer needed design to be in fixed
                                            format - This needed many to and fro communication, we decided on a format
                                            for character length as per best practices for each section of the landing
                                            page.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>Sections looked repetitive, team was using a pre made template for similar
                                            domain
                                        </li>
                                        <li>We (Landing Page Design Team) at times missed reminding for necessary
                                            details that were not shared by client already. I had to ensure team asked
                                            for missing details proactively to customer success team for example -
                                            testimonials or images or company product stats to avoid delay in delivery.

                                    domains to reduce mobile scroll, after qualitative inputs we found that for interior
                                    domains people are not

                                    it let to more conversions by 32% (education domain). In healthcare domain the
                                    qualitative analysis showed that personas identified landing pages with more menus
                                    as informative and more skilled to do the job compared to less menu or no top menu.

                                            Discovered landing page patterns for each of our 20+ client domains.
                                            These patterns were observed after qualitative + quantitative feedback for
                                            the domains.
                                            I created a documentation for each domain - section wise details that should
                                            be shown in sequence.

                                            In case lead conversion is low - We ( Design team ) study quantitative
                                            feedback with MS clarity for client in case lead conversion is affected,
                                            unless new domain is in the picture in which case we talk to client
                                            customers as well.

                                    minutes, achieving exponential
                                    scalability. We went back to 3 days timeline as AI is consuming large amount of
