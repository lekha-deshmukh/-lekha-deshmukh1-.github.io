                            and enabled students to attend it from their LearniCo Student mobile app.

                                    teachers make it a point to convey the information of lecture timings on 2-3
                                    different platforms. Most frequently used medium is WhatsApp & Google classroom,

                                    The recording feature also proved to be helpful for teachers as they could share
