<div class="quote">
    “Can I take attendance with LearniCo? ”
</div>

When digging into the requirement of developing attendance module for online mode we captured below insights 
<ul>
    <li>
        Students did not attend the entire class and <strong> appeared only during attendance time</strong>
    </li>
    <li>
        Students <strong>joined the class late by 15-20 minutes</strong> not paying respect to teacher’s time
    </li>
    <li>
        Since covid, teachers started online classroom sessions where it was tough for them to <strong>keep track of latecomers</strong> in the classroom
    </li>
    <li>
        Those teachers who took the attendance in first 10 minutes has very <strong>less students remaining by the end of the lecture</strong>
    </li>
</ul>

                            I performed a competitor research with the help of secondary data available on the internet where I checked how teachers take attendance from edu-tech products like Moodle and Google classroom and understood how they take attendance.

<strong>Problem</strong> - It is not created for Indian College and Indian students, the teacher has to do data entry for the student manually which is very troublesome for Indian teachers.

<strong>Problem</strong> - It fails to take attendance in Indian setup as students immediately share links of the google form with their friends who are absent in the class session.

                            It was required to release this feature in few weeks, for the same we arranged an ideation meeting, which included  - The Product Manager, Program Manager and myself.
                            <br></br>

The ideation started off discussing about the problems and insights noted above and I was thinking how can teacher most easily conduct attendance with LearniCo.

                                While I was empathising as teacher and recalling a situation where I had to see who all are present in a session an idea occurred to me.  I recalled a recent event of my team mate’s farewell, which was conducted on google meet where I was searching who all were present in the farewell, this was when the idea of showing every student’s face came. I pitched in the idea and it was an instant favourite amongst my team members.
                         
                        </div>

                            I was aware that we had already developed a face ID detection module for the student mobile application, so this faceID module, which was already developed came in handy to recognise faces of students in the class for attendance.

                            Empathising with teacher’s other problems we decided to have a settings interface, with the following features
                        </div>
                        <div class="case-content-strong">

                                <li>Teacher can decide the minimum lecture duration that student must have attended to mark student as “PRESENT” in the system.</li>
                                <li>System can suggest the common students who were present at all instances of attendance</li>
                                <li>System can suggest maximum number of students from all attendance instances</li>

                        </div>
<div class="case-content">
    On the online classroom session page, we decided to show the attendance button, which will be easily available for teacher to click on it. The attendance button allowed 
<ul>
    <li>
        Teacher to select any of the attendance instances from the summary
    </li>
    <li>
        Teacher to take attendance anytime in entire session
    </li>
</ul>
</div>
                        
<div class="case-content-strong">
    At technical level I suggested we take screenshot of the attendance screen which will be captured by system which can show the teacher who all were present in the classroom at all instances, this way we didn’t have to store the names of all students during attendance summary.

<div class="case-content">
    To validate the idea with teachers I quickly created a prototype and shared it with my team and senior members and junior designers for open feedback.

The focus of this design was to show all the interactive tabs on the left side of the screen so that teacher can <strong>easily take a glance at all of them and decide to click on any of the required tab</strong>. 
<br/>
The most interactive part was placed on top left which is the Absent, on clicking it teacher can see all the absent students in the class. The student names were shown on tooltips with option to allow or block the student

                            Design 3 <br/>Horizontal tab view layout, this layout was created <strong>to have clear navigation amongst different tabs & enough space for searching student names.</strong>  It was also needed to give most importance to the left most label “Absent” students and least importance to the right most tab i.e. Blocked students. The most interactive element being the Absent student count was in the left most part of the screen.  All the labels act as filters.

The search was dominant in this design compared to Design 2.
