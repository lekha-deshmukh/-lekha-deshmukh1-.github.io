                                    Since covid, teachers started online classroom sessions where it was tough for them

                            It was required to release this feature in few weeks, for the same we arranged an ideation
                            meeting, which included - The Product Manager, Program Manager and myself.
                            <br></br>

                            The ideation started off discussing about the problems and insights noted above and I was
                            thinking how can teacher most easily conduct attendance with LearniCo.

                            While I was empathising as teacher and recalling a situation where I had to see who all are
                            present in a session an idea occurred to me. I recalled a recent event of my team mate’s
                            farewell, which was conducted on google meet where I was searching who all were present in
                            the farewell, this was when the idea of showing every student’s face came. I pitched in the
                            idea and it was an instant favourite amongst my team members.

                            I was aware that we had already developed a face ID detection module for the student mobile
                            application, this faceID module was to be used to verify studnet's face while they answer a
                            question. This face ID POC was already done and it came in handy to show the faces of
                            students in the class for attendance.
                            The teacher is now a medium to recognise faces and train LearniCo System for face
                            recognition.

                            instances, this way we didn’t have to store the names of all students during attendance

                            Design 1 - Showing names of all students. This design was not proving helpful for viewing
                            student’s live photo. So I created a 2nd design.

                            Design 2<br />

                            The focus of this design was to show all the interactive tabs on the left side of the screen
                            so that teacher can <strong>easily take a glance at all of them and decide to click on any
                                of the required tab</strong>.
                            <br />
                            The most interactive part was placed on top left which is the Absent, on clicking it teacher
                            can see all the absent students in the class. The student names were shown on tooltips with
                            option to allow or block the student
                        </div>

                            Design 3 <br />Horizontal tab view layout, this layout was created <strong>to have clear
                                navigation amongst different tabs & enough space for searching student names.</strong>
                            It was also needed to give most importance to the left most label “Absent” students and
                            least importance to the right most tab i.e. Blocked students. The most interactive element
                            being the Absent student count was in the left most part of the screen. All the labels act
                            as filters.
                            <br /><br />
                            The search was dominant in this design compared to Design 2.

                            The Design 3 from prototype was a clear winner as it gave the required tabs, i.e. Absent
                            Students, Present Students, New entries and Total more attention than Design 2
